### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Deji Joseph**, a freelance web developer and transport manager here.

Forever curious, my repos largely contain experiments, simple scripts, quick web apps, and unfinished projects. Sadly, more involved projects I've worked on are not mine (freelance), so I can't show them.

My new mantra, though: do big things, _and complete them_.

What I'm currently working on:

- Project/Frosty: a private blog, built on a micro-service architechture (another experiment)
- Project/Pusher: a cli controlled background script to automatically upload files to Google Drive
- (in a bit) OpenSource/twist.moe: contributing to an opensource project and feeding my fascination with Anime :)

I'll maintain a resume-like repo [here.](https://wrecodde.github.io) It should contain things like my skills and professional experience.

Cheers.

Deji
