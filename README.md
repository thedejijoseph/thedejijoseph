### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**Deji Joseph**, a web software developer, interested in the finance and transport space.

Forever curious, my repos largely contain experiments, simple scripts, quick web apps, and unfinished projects.

My mantra: do big things, _and complete them_.

What I'm currently working on:

- Project/Travel Info: a directory of information relevant to travel in Nigeria
- Project/Pusher: a cli tool (running in the background) to automatically upload files to Google Drive
- Project/Frosty: a private blog, built on a micro-service architechture (another experiment)
- (in a bit) OpenSource/twist.moe: contributing to an opensource project and feeding my fascination with Anime :)

More about me [here.](https://wrecodde.github.io)

Cheers.

Deji
