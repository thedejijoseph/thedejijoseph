### Hii ðŸ‘‹

I'm Deji, a software engineer, data analyst and product manager. I've led teams and built products in health, logistics, and finance.

I love working on exciting projects that transforms lives and accelerates businesses. When I'm not building, I'm learning.

I also write, sometimes. [Deji's Notes](https://dejisnotes.com).
